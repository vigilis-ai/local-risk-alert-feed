# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **FAA Airport Status plugin** (`FAAAirportStatusPlugin`) — ground stops, ground delay programs, arrival/departure delays, and closures at major US airports from the FAA national feed (`https://nasstatus.faa.gov/`, XML, keyless). Global coverage over a built-in table of ~32 major airports (incl. ATL, JFK, LGA, EWR); emits an alert only when a major airport within `proximityMeters` (default 40km) of the query appears in the feed. Closures→extreme, ground stops→severe, ground/arrival delays scaled by minutes. Adds a `fetchXml` helper to `BasePlugin` (via `fast-xml-parser`) and a `./plugins/airport` export. Unit-tested duration parser.
- **Atlanta Plugins** — Initial coverage for Atlanta, GA (Delta Air Lines main campus / Hartsfield-Jackson airport):
  - `AtlantaCrimePlugin` — NIBRS crime incidents from the Atlanta Police Department Open Data hosted ArcGIS feature layer (`OpenDataWebsite_Crime_view`, updated hourly, includes precise lat/lng). Centered on downtown (33.7490, -84.3880) with a 40km radius that covers the airport ~13km south. Risk mapped from NIBRS offense + `Crime_Against`; firearm-involved incidents are escalated one level. No API key required.
  - `AtlantaTrafficPlugin` — Traffic incidents, closures, and construction from Georgia DOT's 511 system (`https://511ga.org/api/v2/get/event`), 60km radius covering the I-285 perimeter and major interstates. Requires the free `GEORGIA_511_API_KEY` (throttled to 10 calls / 60s); falls back to that env var if `config.apiKey` is not passed.
- **NYC Plugins** — Coverage for New York City:
  - `NYCCrimePlugin` — Felony/misdemeanor/violation complaints from the NYPD via NYC Open Data (Socrata `5uac-w243`, GeoJSON, precise lat/lng). Centered on Manhattan (40.73, -73.99) with a 30km radius covering all five boroughs, the Financial District and Hudson Yards (Manhattan), and JFK (Queens, ~21km SE). Server-side spatial filter via `within_circle`. Risk is the higher of the law-category baseline (FELONY→high, MISDEMEANOR→moderate, VIOLATION→low) and an offense-keyword mapping. Updated quarterly (not a real-time dispatch feed). No API key required.
  - `NYCTrafficPlugin` — Real-time traffic incidents, closures, and construction from NYSDOT's 511NY system (`https://511ny.org/api/getevents`). Same iBI511 vendor schema as GA511 but keyless, with `DD/MM/YYYY` date parsing and `IsFullClosure` inferred from EventType/LanesStatus. Statewide feed filtered to a 30km NYC radius (covers FiDi, Hudson Yards, and the JFK feeder highways — Van Wyck Expressway, Belt Parkway). Complements the quarterly crime data with near-real-time road conditions. No API key required.
- **Package Exports** — Added `AtlantaCrimePlugin` / `AtlantaTrafficPlugin` / `NYCCrimePlugin` / `NYCTrafficPlugin` to `src/plugins/index.ts` and new `./plugins/atlanta` and `./plugins/nyc` modules.
- Test scripts: `scripts/test-atlanta.ts` (pass airport coords `33.6407 -84.4277 8000` to focus on the Delta campus) and `scripts/test-nyc.ts` (tours FiDi, Hudson Yards, JFK with crime + traffic).
- `GEORGIA_511_API_KEY` documented in `.env.example`.

### Notes
- Fire/EMS and events plugins for Atlanta are not yet included: Atlanta Fire Rescue does not publish a public real-time incident feed comparable to Austin/Seattle, and events would route through Ticketmaster (as Phoenix/Glendale do). Both are candidates for a follow-up.
- **Jersey City, NJ has no usable live crime API.** Its open-data portal (`data.jerseycitynj.gov`) only exposes historical snapshots (JCPD calls-for-service tops out at 2017-08-01); the newer "real-time crime portal" is a dashboard not exposed via API. NYPD data does not cover NJ. A Jersey City feed would require scraping the dashboard or another source.
- NYPD complaint data is the freshest citywide open crime source but lags ~one quarter; `NYCTrafficPlugin` (511NY) adds the near-real-time layer. Other NYC complements evaluated and skipped for now: **Notify NYC** emergency notifications (NYC OpenData `8vv7-7wx3`) are ~9 months stale and carry no coordinates; **FDNY incident dispatch** (`8m42-w767`) lags ~one quarter like crime.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-06-13

### Added
- **Generic relative time windows** — `resolveTimeRange` now accepts arbitrary `past-{n}{h|d|w}` / `next-{n}{h|d|w}` windows (e.g. `past-48h`, `next-3d`, `past-2w`), not just the named presets. Exposed as a standalone `parseRelativeRange(value, now?)` helper. Spans are clamped to a 366-day maximum (`MAX_RELATIVE_RANGE_MS`).

### Fixed
- **Unknown time-range no longer crashes downstream queries** — `resolveTimeRangePreset` previously had no `default` branch, so an unrecognized preset returned `undefined` and any downstream read of `.start`/`.end` threw `Cannot read properties of undefined`. It now always returns a valid window. `resolveTimeRange` is hardened end-to-end: unknown strings and malformed explicit ranges fall back to the default window instead of producing `undefined`.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-04-16

### Added
- **Glendale Plugins** - Three new plugins for Glendale, AZ / Tanger Outlets Phoenix coverage:
  - `GlendaleEventsPlugin` - Events from Ticketmaster for the Glendale Sports & Entertainment District (State Farm Stadium, Desert Diamond Arena, Westgate, Camelback Ranch, Topgolf Glendale). Centered on Tanger Outlets Phoenix at 6800 N 95th Ave. State Farm Stadium events rated `high` risk due to 63,400+ capacity crowd/traffic impact.
  - `GlendalePolicePlugin` - Police calls for service from Glendale PD public spatial layer (332K+ records, updated daily). Uses ArcGIS org `9fVTQQSiODPjLUTa`, Layer 47 with spatial envelope filtering.
  - `GlendaleFirePlugin` - Fire and EMS incidents near Glendale from Phoenix Regional Dispatch with spatial bounding-box filtering. Note: Phoenix Fire data only contains city codes PHX/PDV/LAV — Glendale FD calls are not in this dataset, but Phoenix mutual aid responses in the area are captured.
- **Package Exports** - Added `./plugins/glendale` export path
- Glendale test script (`scripts/test-glendale.ts`) for Tanger Outlets Phoenix integration testing with all 4 time windows (past 7d, today, tomorrow, next 7d)
- Known venue coordinates for Glendale entertainment district (Tanger Outlets, State Farm Stadium, Desert Diamond Arena, Westgate, Camelback Ranch, Topgolf)

## [0.5.0] - 2026-01-28

### Added
